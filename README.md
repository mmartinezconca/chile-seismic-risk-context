# Chile — Seismic Risk Map (QGIS GIS Workflow)

## Tools and Skills
A practical **GIS mapping workflow** that integrates seismic hazard zones with developed land-use layers to support **field planning, risk communication, and geotechnical/environmental insight**.

---

## What this project demonstrates
- Spatial data integration and masking/clipping workflows
- Symbolizing **developed areas** using grouped commercial & industrial land use
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) visualization clipped to region masks
- Organized map layout and clear legend design for rapid stakeholder interpretation
- QA-aligned geospatial documentation and layer consistency

---

## Workflow summary
1. Prepared seismic hazard layers and region mask
2. Generated and clipped KDE visualization using the mask
3. Integrated developed land-use layers for “urban/developed” symbology
4. Applied consistent labeling, symbology, and legend clarity for communication
5. Exported map layouts for presentation and field planning context

---

## Key Outcomes
- High-resolution seismic risk maps for Chile

This project is intentionally scoped as a **skill-building, applied GIS product** to demonstrate field-services readiness and geospatial execution workflows used in consulting environments.

*Built with QGIS. Future updates will expand additional field-focused GIS workflows and QA checks.*
